# About

relay is a event watcher that can take a group of requests, and perform sets of action upon them before processing to a downstream service, such as access control, batching, permissions, or withholding until paritcular time or event conditions are met

(eg: only allow transaction x to be broadcast to y after z on chain condition is observed)
